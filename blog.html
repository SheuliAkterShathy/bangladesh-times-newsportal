    <h1>Answer of some question of blog</h1>

    <p>Question:1. What are the difference between var const and let</p>
    <p>Answer:1: The differences between var, let, and const variable declaration in JavaScript include:
        Variables declared with var and const are scoped to the immediate function body.
        Variables declared with the var keyword are hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable can be accessed in their enclosing scope even before they are declared.
        Variables declared with the let keyword are block-scoped, which means the variables will have scope to the immediate enclosing block.</p>

        <p>Question:2. What are the difference between regular function and arrow function</p>
        <p>Answer 2: Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable. Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions.</p>

        <p>Question:3: what are the difference between map(),forEach(),filter(),find()?</p>
        <p>Answer:3.
            map()::: map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element.map() does not change the original array.

             forEach::: forEach() calls a provided callbackFn function once for each element in an array in ascending index order. It is not invoked for index properties that have been deleted or are uninitialized.
            
            filter()::: The filter() method creates a shallow copy of a portion of a given array, filtered down to just the elements from the given array that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
            
             The find() method returns the value of the first element that passes a test. The find() method executes a function for each array element. The find() method returns undefined if no elements are found. The find() method does not execute the function for empty elements.
            </p>

         <p>Question:4. Why we use template string?</p>
         <p>Answer:4.Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements.
